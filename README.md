# NSMBWRR
A very fun mod designed for retro gamers and futuristic players alike! This is in early development, ETA of any sort of release would be estimated at around about 2028.

# Hello, world!
Hello there kind viewers, and welcome to my project!

First off, a little about myself and this mod:

- I live in a GMT+0 Timezone. Please take this into account when creating issues - if you create them late at night (for me at least) I may not be able to get to them immediately.
- I do other things than this mod. Please do not expect me to be working on this daily! I may take the occasional break.
- I forget a lot of stuff. If I tell you, for example, X feature will be in the next update, and it's months before the release, I may forget to include it. Please be kind, and just notify me of the mistake. You can @mention me on this project's Discord server. You can find the link at the bottom of this README file.
- When I do work on this project, I choose the things I do. Just because you submitted an idea to me 5 days ago does not mean I will have finished it immediately.
- THIS IS A COLOSSAL PROJECT. No other project I run will take as long as this. I will have to make over 60 World Maps and 1200 Levels, more if I add other things to this, not to mention the hours I will inevitably take doing texture mods, coding, and 3d modeling.
- This has a webpage! (or will, depending on when you read this). This will be hosted at https://retropix-nsmbw.github.io and will be linked at the bottom of this page.
- My name is pronounced "Retro Picks". I know already many people may say it as "Ruh Tropics" or "Re Tropics".
