# NSMBWRR

A very fun mod designed for retro gamers and futuristic players alike! This is in early development, ETA of any sort of release would be estimated at around about 2028.

# Hello, world!

Hello there kind viewers, and welcome to my project!

First off, a little about myself and this mod:

- I live in a GMT+0 Timezone. Please take this into account when creating issues - if you create them late at night (for me at least) I may not be able to get to them immediately.
- I do other things than this mod. Please do not expect me to be working on this daily! I may take the occasional break.
- I forget a lot of stuff. If I tell you, for example, X feature will be in the next update, and it's months before the release, I may forget to include it. Please be kind, and just notify me of the mistake. You can @mention me on this project's Discord server. You can find the link at the bottom of this README file.
- When I do work on this project, I choose the things I do. Just because you submitted an idea to me 5 days ago does not mean I will have finished it immediately.
- THIS IS A COLOSSAL PROJECT. No other project I run will take as long as this. I will have to make over 60 World Maps and 1200 Levels, more if I add other things to this, not to mention the hours I will inevitably take doing texture mods, coding, and 3d modeling.
- This has a webpage! (or will, depending on when you read this). This will be hosted at https://retropix-nsmbw.github.io and will be linked at the bottom of this page.
- My name is pronounced "Retro Picks". I know already many people may say it as "Ruh Tropics" or "Re Tropics".

# The Project.

This is a big project! This will be an all-inclusive mod of New Super Mario Bros. Wii - Containing ALL mainline Super Mario Bros. Games, Fangames and more! Game list and creators below. Confirmed games have "^" at the end of them, while games unconfirmed have "<" and games that are being considered have ">" and a reason why.

Nintendo - CONFIRMED

Super Mario Bros.

Super Mario Bros. 2 JPN (lost levels)

Versus Super Mario Bros. - NOTE - This will be a special world you get for 100%'ing SMB1 and SMB2J as this is an arcade game based off of both of them.

Super Mario Bros. 2 WRLD

Super Mario Bros. 3

Super Mario World WRLD / Super Mario Bros 4 JPN

Super Mario Land

Super Mario Land 2 - 6 Golden Coins

New Super Mario Bros. (DS)

New Super Mario Bros. Wii

New Super Mario Bros. 2

New Super Mario Bros. U

New Super Luigi Bros. U

Super Mario Bros. Wonder

Nintendo - UNCONFIRMED

Super Mario Land 3 (Wario Land)

Yoshi's Island (Super Mario World 2)

Super Mario Maker for Nintendo Wii U & 3DS - NOTE: If these were to be added, it would only be the challenge levels and example levels from Wii U and the Mario Challenge from 3DS.

Super Mario Maker 2 - NOTE: This would only be official Nintendo-owned levels, such as Story Mode. Basically, any level that works offline without downloading anything to CourseBot.

Miscellaneous Lost Levels - These are levels found in Nintendo games mentioned so far which have actual gameplay to them. The idea behind this is that it'll function like NSMBW World 9 or SM3DW Crown World. As for the levels included, think of things like the iconic Minus World / World 36 from SMB1. THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE SMB3 OR SMW/SMB4J - These are individual RomHacks and will be treated as such, being marked under Confirmed Fan Games - You will unlock them by completing worlds that are like the theme of the level of both games to 100% completion.

New Super Mario Bros (Insert title) Challenge Levels - Within New U and New 2, there are many "Challenge Levels" - If I get time I may add these as an optional addition to their respective game, as additions to it when you beat the final world in the game, regardless of completion.

Other Nintendo Games - HUGE asterisks on these - If Nintendo doesn't release a new game for when I complete EVERYTHING, I may add these. Think of Mario Is Missing, Donkey Kong, and other platformers Nintendo has released over the years.

Themed Levels - More of an event than a feature idea - If, and only if, Nintendo doesn't release a new game, and the mod is 100% Complete, including the ideas above, will I boot up Reggie! and make levels themed on non-platformer Nintendo games, like maybe using a bouncy mushroom in a cave setting and calling it Mushroom Gorge.

Fan Games - CONFIRMED

Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii

Newer Super Mario Bros. (DS)

Lost Levels of SMB3

Lost Levels of SMW

Hack2 - FanMade SMW/SMB4J RomHack. BlueTelevisionGames did a whole series of this - watch it, it's cool :)

Retropix's Worlds - An unmade mod, I will work on random levels and worldmaps as I develop NSMBWRR and add them to the mod - it should give you an idea of what I may add to this in the future!

Fan Games - UNCONFIRMED

New Super Mario Lost Worlds - a fellow NSMBW hack, run by @nin0_ - The mod looks very promising, and if NSMLW releases before the first full release of NSMBWRR, I will move this into the CONFIRMED tab. In the event of NSMBWRR releasing first, I will rather add it to the next release.

Kaizo Mario Hacks - I may eventually add some levels from kaizo RomHacks of SMW/SMB4J and later games. (SMB1 kaizo relies on bugs from that game, as I have seen at least - like platforms allowing Mario to phase through a wall)

Miscellaneous Additions (ALL will be added eventually - no unconfirmed ones yet)

Test worlds - these will be unlocked from the start. I think it would be great to allow people to see the work I have done without the hassle of beating it - so, as a solution I have decided you will be able to go backwards in SMB1 W1, and into a cannon - where you will be transported to a map full of secrets, easter eggs and changes. Oh, and maybe a Star Coin-protected path, if you go the entire game without missing or spending a Star Coin, you may see the secrets it holds... (You could probably just use cheats through Dolphin or something, but please play along, I promise it'll be fun!)

Victory World - Beat EVERYTHING the mod has to offer? I will make a world which will allow you to experience NSMBWRR in a whole new way! Want to beat SMB1 while riding a Yoshi? Sure! Want to race through every level as if you were a Hammer, Fire, Ice or Boomerang Bro? Definitely! This world serves as the epilogue of my mod - rumor has it if you can beat the level at the end, the final super-mega challenge, you'll get personally thanked for playing! (Through Discord. Send me (@rtrpx) a DM with a picture or screenshot of you beating the mod. I'll be really impressed!)

Event world - If a time of year or event is upcoming (Like the 50th anniversary of SMB1 - we're only 10 years away now!) I may release a *Special* update - this won't happen until the mod exits beta for obvious reasons though. It will be themed, as eluded to at the start of this line. For example, the winter event may include "Ice Bro Ambush" - A level I made about 3 years ago now which takes place in the Winter theme, where Ice Bros shoot Ice Balls at you throughout the stage. It was more fun to play than to make!

# FAQ

You may have a number of questions right now. Please send them to me via Discord so I am able to add these to the FAQ! Current questions:

Why the Wii, of all moddable consoles?

> By far, the Wii has more tools for editing propietary file extensions and games than other consoles. Where is BerryBrush's equivalent for Wii U, for example? How stable is making your own New Super Mario Bros. 2 Level? Without these tools, NSMBWRR would not be possible.
> Also the Wii has the best controls - you can't spin jump using a NES controller!
